${roster}

Assess it using THIS project's effort philosophy — be calibrated, do NOT mark everything high:
- effort is the ladder low | medium | high | xhigh | max | ultracode, and it tracks REASONING DIFFICULTY, not size. Mechanical wiring / CRUD routes / UI pages / adapters mapping a documented API / boilerplate / tests = low or medium. Entity-resolution merge logic (fuzzy matching with tier+recency conflict rules), attestation sign/verify protocol design (key handling, tamper evidence, flat-file survivability), eval-scorer design (faithfulness against attestations, CLIP-likeness thresholds), or migration safety on the append-only corpus = high or xhigh. 'max' = the hardest single-context reasoning — one agent, maximum thinking budget, still no orchestration. 'ultracode' is the TOP rung and means multi-agent orchestration: assign it ONLY when the slice decomposes into parallel work AND is verification-worthy AND a single pass would miss things. Reserve the top two rungs; most slices never reach them — over-marking is the exact failure this project warns about.
- hardness: mechanical | moderate | hard-reasoning.
- model: which model should IMPLEMENT this slice. 'fable' ONLY for hard-reasoning slices where a plausible-but-wrong implementation is the failure mode (merge/conflict logic, crypto protocol edges, eval scorer validity, destructive-migration safety); 'opus' for mechanical and moderate slices (wiring, pages, adapters, straightforward tests) where throughput matters. Track hardness, not size — a big mechanical slice is still 'opus'.
- needs_verification (an adversarial verify pass) = true ONLY when a subtle bug would be costly and a single pass could plausibly ship it wrong (e.g. a merge rule that silently drops a higher-trust fact, a verify function that accepts a tampered attestation, an eval scorer that passes fabricated care claims).
- skills: which Monster Paws skills apply — shipshape (pre-commit gate), deploy (if the slice ends in a production roll), orient (rarely).
- status: todo | partial | done — check the code under src/ rather than assuming.
- depends_on: the exact ids FROM THE ROSTER ABOVE of slices that must land first — [] if none. Do not use any id not in the roster.

Produce a dependency-respecting build plan: group slices into ordered phases (respect depends_on; put any already-'done' slices in a phase 0), identify the critical path, and in 'notes' call out what to batch, which slices genuinely warrant ultracode/adversarial-verify AND which explicitly do NOT, and any sequencing risks. Prefer grouping same-model slices into the same phase where dependencies allow, and set each phase's 'model' from its slices ('mixed' only when unavoidable) — the maintainer batches Fable work and Opus work separately.
